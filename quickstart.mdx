Guru has a gallery of templates that allow you to start developing and testing an app in minutes.
Let's start with one of our most popular templates, **Rep Counting**.

### Use a Template

Log into the [Guru Console](https://console.getguru.fitness/). From here, either click **Quickstart** or **Create**. Choose a template from the dropdown menu. For this tutorial, we'll use **Rep Counting** but any template will do.

### Run the App

Now you are in the **Guru Editor**. We'll dive deeper later, but for now you can click **Run**. This will run the app on the video in the editor, render some graphics, and show the output of the app in the output tab. You can upload new videos using **Upload** to test the app on more videos.

### Deploy and test the API

Eventually you'll want to integrate this app into your own product. To do so, we'll use the **Guru API**. Let's start by clicking **Deploy**. Your app is already live in the Guru API, so we can upload videos to the Guru API from any CLI. Substitute your API credentials in the Deploy into the cURL command below:


```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Recap

To recap, we've created a Guru app, tested it in the browser, deployed it, and uploaded a video to it using the API. Let's dive deeper into what we just did in the next section.
