### Introduction

Guru makes it simple to build complex AI video analysis app. With Guru, you can:

- Combine complex vision models in a few lines of Javascript.
- Test them out on videos right in the browser.
- Deploy your app to the cloud, iOS, or Android in one-click.

To get started, sign up at the [Guru Console](https://console.getguru.fitness/). 

We also recommend joining the Guru Discord to chat with the Guru team and other Guru developers.
